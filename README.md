# Student Performance Analysis Project

## About
Comprehensive exploratory data analysis of student academic performance to identify key demographic and socioeconomic factors influencing test scores in math, reading, and writing.

## Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on student performance data to understand how various demographic, socioeconomic, and educational factors impact academic achievement. The analysis reveals important insights about gender differences, parental education effects, lunch programs, and ethnic group performance patterns.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains **1,000 student records** with **8 features** covering demographic information and test scores:

### Features:
- **Gender**: Student gender (male/female)
- **Race/Ethnicity**: Ethnic group classification (Groups A, B, C, D, E)
- **Parental Level of Education**: Parent's highest education level (6 categories)
  - High school, Some college, Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, Some high school
- **Lunch**: Lunch program type (standard/free or reduced)
- **Test Preparation Course**: Completion status (none/completed)
- **Math Score**: Mathematics test score (0-100)
- **Reading Score**: Reading test score (0-100) 
- **Writing Score**: Writing test score (0-100)

### Dataset Characteristics:
- **Total Records**: 1,000 students
- **Missing Values**: None (complete dataset)
- **Duplicates**: None detected
- **Data Quality**: High (clean dataset)

## Key Findings

### Academic Performance Overview:
| Subject | Mean Score | Std Dev | Min | Max |
|---------|------------|---------|-----|-----|
| Math | 66.1 | 15.2 | 0 | 100 |
| Reading | 69.2 | 14.6 | 17 | 100 |
| Writing | 68.1 | 15.2 | 10 | 100 |

### Critical Insights:

#### 🚺 **Gender Performance Gap**
- **Female students consistently outperform male students** across all subjects
- Gender appears to be a significant factor in academic achievement

#### 🍽️ **Lunch Program Impact**
- **Standard lunch students perform significantly better** than free/reduced lunch students
- This pattern holds true for both male and female students
- Indicates strong correlation between socioeconomic status and academic performance

#### 🎓 **Parental Education Effects**
- **Overall**: Parental education level shows minimal impact on student performance
- **Gender-specific pattern**: Male students with parents having associate's or master's degrees tend to perform better
- **No significant effect** observed for female students

#### 🌍 **Ethnic Group Performance**
- **Groups A and B**: Consistently show lower performance across all subjects
- **Performance disparity** exists regardless of gender
- Suggests potential systemic educational equity issues

#### 📊 **Test Score Correlations**
- **Very strong correlations** between all test scores (0.8-0.97)
- Students who excel in one subject typically excel in others
- Reading and writing show highest correlation (0.95)

## Analysis Performed

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Running the Analysis
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('stud.csv')

# Basic exploration
df.head()
df.info()
df.describe()

# Create derived features
df['total_score'] = df['math_score'] + df['reading_score'] + df['writing_score']
df['average'] = df['total_score'] / 3
```

## Key Visualizations

1. **Performance Distribution by Gender**: Histogram comparison showing female advantage
2. **Lunch Program Impact**: Distribution plots revealing socioeconomic effects
3. **Parental Education Analysis**: Gender-specific educational influence patterns
4. **Ethnic Group Performance**: Comparative analysis across demographic groups
5. **Correlation Heatmap**: Strong relationships between test scores
6. **Score Distribution**: Overall academic performance patterns

## Actionable Insights & Recommendations

### For Educational Policymakers:
- **Address Gender Gap**: Investigate and support strategies to improve male student performance
- **Socioeconomic Support**: Expand lunch programs and support services for disadvantaged students
- **Equity Focus**: Implement targeted interventions for underperforming ethnic groups (A & B)
- **Holistic Approach**: Leverage strong score correlations for comprehensive skill development

### For Educators:
- **Gender-Aware Teaching**: Adapt teaching methods to address gender-specific learning patterns
- **Early Intervention**: Use correlations to identify at-risk students early
- **Parental Engagement**: Focus on engaging parents, especially fathers of male students
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Develop culturally responsive teaching practices

### For Researchers:
- **Deeper Investigation**: Study root causes of performance disparities
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Track performance patterns over time
- **Intervention Testing**: Design and test targeted improvement strategies
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build models to identify at-risk students

## Statistical Significance

- **High Correlation Coefficients**: All test scores show correlations > 0.80
- **Clear Performance Patterns**: Consistent trends across demographic groups
- **Sample Size**: 1,000 students provide statistically meaningful insights
- **Data Completeness**: No missing data ensures reliable analysis

## Future Work
